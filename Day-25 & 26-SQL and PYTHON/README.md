✅ SQL — Recursive CTEs Unlocked:
Took CTEs to the next level with recursion — powerful tools for working with hierarchical data and automated sequence generation:

🔁 Generated sequences without loops

🌳 Built hierarchies from parent-child data models
This skill is vital for org charts, category trees, or tracking data lineage.

✅ Python — Entering the World of NumPy:
NumPy makes data analysis blazing fast — practiced real-world array manipulations:

✅ Array creation & reshaping

➕➖✖️➗ Element-wise operations

🔍 Slicing, boolean indexing

📊 Statistical functions: mean, std, min, max

⚡ np.where for conditional filtering

🎲 Random sampling for simulations
NumPy is the foundation of Pandas, machine learning, and even data visualization.
