✅ SQL — More String & Numeric Functions:
Today I practiced:

REPLACE() — fix or update text in columns

LEN() — find string length

TRIM() — clean up spaces

LEFT(), RIGHT() — extract substrings

SUBSTRING() — get specific parts of a string

Nesting functions — combine multiple functions in one query

ROUND() — round numbers

ABS() — get absolute values
Wrote real queries for each to see how they work in reporting and cleaning data.

✅ Python — Lists (Next Level):

insert() — add at a specific index

remove() — delete an item

append(), extend() — add items & merge lists

Slicing — work with parts of a list

join() — not for lists directly but for joining list elements into strings
Practiced with small programs to get the logic right.
