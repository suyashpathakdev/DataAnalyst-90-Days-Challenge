🚀 Day 27/90 — Completed Deloitte Australia's Data Analytics Virtual Internship!

Today, I completed a real-world simulation by Deloitte Australia (via Forage) — where I stepped into the shoes of a Data Analyst working on a forensic technology project.

✅ What I Did:
🔍 Simulated a Deloitte consulting case
📊 Built a dashboard using Tableau to visualize insights
📁 Used Excel for classification & data cleaning
📈 Interpreted data to draw business conclusions

🎓 This simulation helped me experience how data is used in consulting, forensic analysis, and real client situations.
