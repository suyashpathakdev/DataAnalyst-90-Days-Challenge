✅ SQL — Subqueries (The Hidden Superpower):
Subqueries allow you to query inside a query, making logic modular, powerful, and readable.
Practiced multiple use cases including:
1️⃣ Result Types — scalar, table, and column subqueries
2️⃣ FROM clause — use subqueries as virtual tables
3️⃣ SELECT clause — calculate additional fields dynamically
4️⃣ JOIN clause — enrich main tables with subquery data
5️⃣ Comparison Operators, IN, ANY, EXISTS — powerful filters
6️⃣ Correlated Subqueries — dynamic, row-by-row filtering

These are essential tools in reporting, filtering, and performance optimization.

✅ Python — Real-World Data Cleanup (Mini Project Style):
Given a dataset (list of dictionaries) with messy text fields, I wrote a program to:

Convert 'job_date' strings into datetime objects

Convert 'job_skills' stringified lists into actual Python lists
This is what real data preprocessing looks like before insights and analysis happen.
