✅ SQL — Date & Time Functions:
demonstrates various date and time functions in SQL.
   It covers functions such as GETDATE, DATETRUNC, DATENAME, DATEPART,
   YEAR, MONTH, DAY, EOMONTH, FORMAT, CONVERT, CAST, DATEADD, DATEDIFF,
   and ISDATE.
Today I focused on handling dates — a must for any real reporting job:
GETDATE — get current date/time
DATETRUNC — truncate date to month, year, etc.
DATENAME, DATEPART — extract parts of a date
YEAR, MONTH, DAY — get year, month, day separately
EOMONTH — end of month
FORMAT — format date output
CONVERT, CAST — change data types
DATEADD, DATEDIFF — add/subtract dates & find difference
ISDATE — check if value is a valid date
Wrote real queries for each — practice is the best teacher!
