✅ SQL — Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
CTEs help break down big queries into clean, readable blocks — and make debugging a dream. Today I explored:
1️⃣ Non-Recursive CTEs — used them to simplify aggregations and filters
🧠 Helps structure multi-step analysis without using subqueries repeatedly

🔜 Recursive CTEs coming next — they’re game changers for sequences and hierarchies.

✅ Python — Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Started writing Python classes and learned how to structure code more like a developer:

Created simple classes

Used __init__() for initializing object properties

Overrode __str__() for clean object representation

Wrote custom methods and interacted with object instances
This is the foundation of scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and machine learning workflows.
