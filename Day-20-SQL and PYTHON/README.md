✅ SQL — Window Ranking Functions:
These functions make sorted, ranked, and bucketed insights possible without complex joins. I practiced:

ROW_NUMBER() — assign a unique row number per partition

RANK() vs DENSE_RANK() — know the difference when there are ties

NTILE() — split data into equal-sized groups (quartiles, deciles, etc.)

CUME_DIST() — find a row’s position as a percentile

This is must-know logic behind leaderboards, sales rankings, customer segmentation, and performance tiers.

✅ Python — Lambda Functions:
Wrote multiple programs using lambda (anonymous) functions — powerful one-liners that:

Keep code clean

Work perfectly with map(), filter(), and sorted()

Help write fast, flexible logic
