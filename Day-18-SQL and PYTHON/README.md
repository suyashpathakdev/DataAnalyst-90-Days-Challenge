✅ SQL — Window Aggregate Functions:
Took SQL one step deeper with window-based aggregates — combining the power of GROUP BY and row-level detail in one go.
Practiced:

COUNT() — track frequencies while keeping rows visible

SUM() — total up sales, metrics, or values without collapsing data

AVG() — get smooth insights across partitions

These functions are key for reporting dashboards, trend analysis, and real-time BI — and I’m getting sharper at writing them efficiently.

✅ Python — Daily Logic Drills:
Did focused exercises on:

Variables & Operators

Conditional Statements

Lists & Dictionaries

Loops — for, while
These aren’t just basics — they’re the core of clean, reusable code. I used this day to reinforce foundations before moving into more complex logic.
