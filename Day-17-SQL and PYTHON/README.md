🚀 Day 17/90 — From Simple Scripts to Advanced Data Thinking

Today I dove into one of the most powerful tools in SQL — window functions — and added more Python magic with list comprehensions.

✅ SQL — Window Functions (Real Analyst Toolkit):
Window functions allow you to run calculations across rows without messy subqueries. I explored:
1️⃣ OVER clause — the base of all window functions
2️⃣ PARTITION BY — segment data into logical groups
3️⃣ ORDER BY — sort within partitions for rankings, trends
4️⃣ FRAME clause — control the range of rows used in calculations
5️⃣ Applied these in real aggregation + GROUP BY use cases

This is the logic behind rankings, running totals, moving averages — real patterns in business dashboards.

✅ Python — List Comprehension:
Wrote programs using list comprehensions to write cleaner, faster Python code:

Simplified loops into one-liners

Created filtered and transformed lists in seconds

Practiced multiple use cases for data prep and quick logic
