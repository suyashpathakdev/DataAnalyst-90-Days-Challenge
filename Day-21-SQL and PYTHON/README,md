✅ SQL — Window Value Functions:
These functions let me access data from other rows — without any joins. It’s how advanced analysts spot trends, changes, and context.
I practiced:

LEAD() — peek at the next row’s value

LAG() — look back at the previous row

FIRST_VALUE() — get the first value in a partition

LAST_VALUE() — access the last value in a group

This logic is used in trend detection, churn analysis, sales comparisons, and time-series analysis.

 ✅ Python — Modules:
Today’s focus: writing clean, reusable code. I worked on:

Creating custom modules

Accessing functions from modules

Importing modules the right way (import, from, as)
This is the foundation for scalable code — the kind used in real software and analysis pipelines.
