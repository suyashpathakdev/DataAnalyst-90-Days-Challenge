Today’s learning wasn’t flashy — but it’s the real stuff that breaks dashboards and confuses reports if you ignore it.
I faced the invisible enemies in SQL — NULLs & tricky joins.


✅ SQL — NULLs, Joins & Hidden Pitfalls:
🔍 Wrote practical queries to:
1️⃣ Handle NULLs in Aggregations — avoid fake averages & sums.
2️⃣ Deal with NULLs in Math Ops — no more accidental NULL results.
3️⃣ Sort data with NULLs — so blanks don’t mess up order.
4️⃣ Use NULLIF — stop division by zero dead in its tracks.
5️⃣ Master IS NULL & IS NOT NULL — filter data properly.
6️⃣ Tried a LEFT ANTI JOIN — find what’s missing, not just what’s matching.
7️⃣ Compared NULLs vs Empty Strings vs Blank Spaces — they look same but break code differently.

🔹 Python:


Broke down Tuples like a pro

Indexed, sliced, unpacked

Switched tuples to lists to add/remove stuff (because tuples don’t bend)

Combined tuples, printed with f-strings — the clean way!
