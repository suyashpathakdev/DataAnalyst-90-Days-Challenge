ðŸš€ Day 13/90 â€” Real-World Data Skills in Progress + Something Big Coming!

Another solid day, another proof-of-skill update â€” because talking is easy, showing up daily isnâ€™t.

âœ… SQL â€” Dates & Time, Real Use Cases:
Today I doubled down on:

CONVERT() â€” change data types for better reporting

DATEADD() â€” shift dates for trend analysis

DATEDIFF() â€” find gaps and durations

ISDATE() â€” catch bad date data before it breaks queries
Wrote more queries that feel real, not just textbook.

âœ… Python â€” Sets:
Practiced programs using sets â€” to remove duplicates, handle unique items, and keep data clean. Sets make so many real-world data tasks simpler!
