✅ SQL — Aggregate Functions:
Today I practiced the backbone of data reporting — aggregate functions:

COUNT — how many rows?

SUM — total sales, costs, anything.

AVG — find averages.

MAX & MIN — best & worst performers.
Plus, I grouped data using GROUP BY — so numbers mean something when split by category, month, or product.

This is how raw tables become useful dashboards!

✅ Python — Loops:
Wrote programs using loops:

for loops — repeat tasks cleanly

while loops — run until a condition changes
Loops = automate repetitive work, from cleaning rows to processing lists.
