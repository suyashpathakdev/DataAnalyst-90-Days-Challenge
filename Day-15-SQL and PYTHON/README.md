✅ SQL — Mastering the CASE Statement:
Wrote scripts to handle real use cases with CASE:
1️⃣ Categorize Data — turn raw numbers into labels
2️⃣ Mapping — transform messy codes into readable categories
3️⃣ Quick Form — simple IF/ELSE logic
4️⃣ Handling NULLs — clean up incomplete data
5️⃣ Conditional Aggregation — build custom summaries in one query

CASE turns static data into useful insights — a must-have for any reporting role.

✅ Python — Advanced Operators:
Today was about controlling logic:

Logical operators — and, or, not

Identity operators — is, is not

Membership operators — in, not in

Bitwise operators — work at the binary level, super useful for low-level tasks

Wrote small programs to see how they actually work in real conditions.
