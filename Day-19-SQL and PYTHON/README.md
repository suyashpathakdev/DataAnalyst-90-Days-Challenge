✅ SQL — Window Functions (Continued):
Reinforced my understanding with more real-world queries using window functions.
Focused on improving:

Row-by-row calculations

Rankings, rolling totals, and segment-based metrics
The more I practice these, the more I see how BI dashboards and analyst reports are built behind the scenes.

✅ Python — Functions:
Wrote several Python programs using custom functions — learning how to:

Organize logic

Reuse code blocks

Accept parameters and return results
This step brings everything together — clean, modular, job-ready code.
